+# Binary Asset Workflow
+
+Some corporate Git hosts block commits that contain generated or binary artifacts. This project keeps the repository
+source-only and rebuilds any binaries locally. Follow the steps below whenever you need the compiled assets.
+
+## Frontend build artifacts
+
+1. Install dependencies (requires Node 18+):
+   ```bash
+   cd frontend
+   npm install
+   ```
+2. Create a production bundle:
+   ```bash
+   npm run build
+   ```
+3. The generated assets are written to `frontend/dist/`. These files are ignored by Git. Deployments copy this folder into the
+   frontend container image during `docker-compose build`. If your Git provider blocks binary pushes, run the build locally and
+   include the build step in your CI/CD pipeline instead of committing the `dist` directory.
+
+## Backend compiled bytecode
+
+Python `.pyc` bytecode files and SQLite databases are created at runtime and excluded from the repository via `.gitignore`.
+To recreate them locally:
+
+```bash
+cd backend
+python -m venv .venv
+source .venv/bin/activate
+pip install -r requirements.txt
+python -m compileall app
+```
+
+This produces the same bytecode artifacts that appear when the backend container runs. Do **not** commit the resulting
+`__pycache__` directories or the SQLite database file; they are generated automatically when the service starts.
+
+## Docker images
+
+Docker images are binary blobs and cannot be pushed to Git. Build them locally or in your CI environment using:
+
+```bash
+docker-compose build
+```
+
+The `Dockerfile`s copy only source code and install dependencies so the resulting image is reproducible without storing binaries
+in Git.
+
+## Sample data files
+
+If you need example transactions for testing, generate them from the provided template instead of committing exported spreadsheets.
+Run:
+
+```bash
+python scripts/generate_sample_transactions.py
+```
+
+This script writes CSV files under `samples/` (ignored by Git). You can adjust the generator to mirror your data without uploading
+proprietary bank exports.
+
+## CI/CD tip
+
+Configure your CI pipeline to run the commands above as build steps. That way, reviewers can clone the repo, execute the documented
+scripts, and produce the same binaries locally—no binary commits required.
+
+## Check for binary files before committing
+
+Run the helper script below to verify that staged files decode as UTF-8 text and to catch stray binary artifacts before opening a
+pull request:
+
+```bash
+python scripts/check_no_binaries.py
+```
+
+The script returns a non-zero exit code and prints the offending paths if it detects binary-like content, helping you keep pull
+requests source-only.
